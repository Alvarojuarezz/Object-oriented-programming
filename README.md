# Object-oriented-programming

This repository contains three distinct Java projects, each designed to showcase object-oriented programming (OOP) principles in real-world scenarios. These projects provide hands-on practice with encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction while solving practical problems. Below is a brief description of each project:

1. Veterinary Clinic Management System
A management system for a veterinary clinic that handles the registration and management of pets, their owners, and medical appointments.
Features:
Add, search, and update pet and owner details.
Schedule and manage medical appointments.
Maintain a history of treatments for each pet.
OOP Concepts:
Relationships: Associations between pets and their owners.
Abstraction and encapsulation in handling appointment scheduling and histories.

3. Camping Ticket Management System
A system designed to handle ticket purchases and reservations for a camping site. It tracks visitor information, available spots, and booking statuses.
Features:
Reserve camping spots based on availability.
Track ticket purchases and cancellations.
Generate reports on total bookings and occupancy rates.
OOP Concepts:
Inheritance: Special types of spots (e.g., tent vs. RV).
Polymorphism: Different ticket pricing strategies based on visitor type.

3. Cinema Ticket Booking System
A streamlined ticketing system for a cinema that supports seat selection, movie scheduling, and ticket sales.
Features:
Browse movie listings and showtimes.
Reserve specific seats for a chosen show.
Calculate ticket prices based on seat type (e.g., VIP or regular).
OOP Concepts:
Encapsulation: Handling seat availability and pricing logic.
Interfaces: Define rules for discount strategies (e.g., student or senior discounts).
